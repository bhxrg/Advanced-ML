Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are computational models composed of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers.
These networks learn from data by adjusting the weights and biases of connections between neurons during a training process.
ANNs can capture intricate patterns and relationships, making them suitable for various machine learning tasks.
