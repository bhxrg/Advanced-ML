Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that builds a collection of decision trees and combines their predictions to create a more accurate and stable model.
It introduces randomness by using bootstrapped samples and randomly selecting subsets of features for each tree,
aiming to reduce overfitting and enhance the model's predictive performance.
