XGBoost, or Extreme Gradient Boosting, is an advanced implementation of gradient boosting. 
It utilizes decision trees as base learners and optimizes a regularized objective function. 
XGBoost incorporates parallel computing and tree pruning techniques to enhance efficiency and prevent overfitting,making it highly effective for various machine learning tasks.
